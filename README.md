## Overview

Using this framework, you can sign an `EosioTransactionSignatureRequest` using `K1` and `R1` type private keys.

## Basic Usage

To Import private key

```java
String privateKeyEOS = "Your eos format private key in K1 or R1 type"
SoftKeySignatureProviderImpl provider = new SoftKeySignatureProviderImpl();
try {
  provider.importKey(privateKeyEOS);
} catch (ImportKeyError importKeyError) {
  importKeyError.printStackTrace();
}
```

To sign a `EosioTransactionSignatureRequest`, you should first create it with your serialized transaction and list of public keys. Eosio-java handle the creation of the object for you.
Finally, Call signTransaction to sign.

```java
try {
  String serializedTransaction = "Your serialized transaction";
  List<String> publicKeys = Arrays.asList("Your eos format public key in K1 or R1 type");
  EosioTransactionSignatureRequest request = new EosioTransactionSignatureRequest(serializedTransaction, publicKeys, chainId, null, false);
  EosioTransactionSignatureResponse response = provider.signTransaction(request);
} catch (SignTransactionError signTransactionError) {
  signTransactionError.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Contents of the library

This library is an example implementation of `ISignatureProvider`. It implements the following methods:

* `EosioTransactionSignatureResponse signTransaction(EosioTransactionSignatureRequest eosioTransactionSignatureRequest)` signs an `Transaction`.
* `List<String> getAvailableKeys()` returns an list, containing the public keys associated with the private keys that is added to the object.

Importing key by calling

* `importKey(String privateKey)`

## Installation

This provider is intended to be used in conjunction with [EOSIO SDK for Java](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java) as a simple sample for signature provider provider.

To use Softkey signature Provider with EOSIO SDK for Java in your app, add the following modules to your build.gradle:

**TODO** This needs to be updated when the distribution strategy is finalized.

```java
implementation 'one.block:eosio-java:0.1-alpha'
implementation 'one.block:eosio-java-android-serialization-provider:0.1-alpha'
implementation 'one.block:eosio-java-softkey-signature-provider:0.1-alpha'
```

Then refresh your gradle project.

Now Softkey signature provider is ready for use within EOSIO SDK for Java according to the [EOSIO SDK for Java Basic Usage instructions](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-java/tree/develop#basic-usage).
